## 🔍 What I Accomplished

### 1. Data Integration & Preprocessing
- **Multi-dataset Merging**: Successfully integrated train, features, and stores datasets
- **Data Alignment**: Properly aligned data using Store, Date, and IsHoliday columns
- **Date Processing**: Converted date columns to datetime format and set as index
- **Time Series Preparation**: Resampled data to weekly frequency for trend analysis

### 2. Time Series Analysis
- **Trend Visualization**: Created comprehensive weekly sales trend charts
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identified key sales patterns and fluctuations
- **Data Quality**: Ensured clean, properly formatted time series data

### 3. Moving Average Implementation
- **4-Week Moving Average**: Calculated rolling mean to smooth out short-term fluctuations
- **Trend Identification**: Used moving averages to identify underlying sales trends
- **Visualization**: Overlaid moving averages on actual sales data for comparison

### 4. Seasonal Decomposition
- **Additive Model**: Applied seasonal decomposition using additive model
- **Component Analysis**: Separated time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components
- **Pattern Understanding**: Identified seasonal patterns and cyclical behaviors

### 5. Forecasting Techniques
- **Rolling Mean Forecast**: Implemented simple forecasting using rolling averages
- **Trend Projection**: Created forecasts based on historical moving averages
- **Visualization**: Displayed forecasted values alongside actual sales data

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Key Libraries Used
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and time series operations
- `matplotlib`: Data visualization and charting
- `statsmodels`: Time series analysis and decomposition
- `matplotlib.dates`: Date formatting and time series plotting

### Time Series Techniques Applied

#### 1. Data Resampling
```python
weekly_sales = merged_df['Weekly_Sales'].resample('W').sum()
```

#### 2. Moving Average Calculation
```python
moving_avg = weekly_sales.rolling(window=4).mean()
```

#### 3. Seasonal Decomposition
```python
decomposition = seasonal_decompose(weekly_sales, model='additive')
```

#### 4. Forecasting Implementation
```python
rolling_mean_forecast = weekly_sales.rolling(window=4).mean()
```
