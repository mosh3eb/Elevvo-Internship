### SQL Query Examples

#### Top Products Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
    t.Name AS Product,
    SUM(il.Quantity) AS TotalSold
FROM InvoiceLine il
JOIN Track t ON il.TrackId = t.TrackId
GROUP BY t.Name
ORDER BY TotalSold DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### Revenue by Country
```sql
SELECT 
    c.Country,
    ROUND(SUM(il.Quantity * il.UnitPrice), 2) AS Revenue
FROM InvoiceLine il
JOIN Invoice i ON il.InvoiceId = i.InvoiceId
JOIN Customer c ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
GROUP BY c.Country
ORDER BY Revenue DESC;
```

#### Window Functions Implementation
```sql
SELECT 
    t.Name AS Product,
    SUM(il.Quantity) AS TotalSold,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(il.Quantity) DESC) AS RankBySales
FROM InvoiceLine il
JOIN Track t ON il.TrackId = t.TrackId
GROUP BY t.Name
ORDER BY RankBySales;
```
